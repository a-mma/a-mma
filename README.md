# a-mma
`Amma` is a cross-language, Indian word for `Mother`. Mother is a symbol of care and affection. `a-mma` pronounced as `eəmmʌ` (loosely, `emma`) is a unique name that we would like to give this agender character in the digital world for world-wide recognition.

`a-mma` is a non-profit, community first initiative. Currently, in the short term, it's a volunteered `umbrella label` for projects, research, and activities that aligns within the space of `Decentralised Collective Intelligence`. In the medium to long term, it is destined to become a non-profit organization and then to an autonomous organization with decentralized governance.

`a-mma` will function as a community hub for efforts that happen under `Decentralised Collective Intelligence`. `a-mma` could ensure a shared, thriving community which gives a sandbox (`womb`) for the efforts in the space through mutual benefit. `a-mma` is very open to personals, startups, enterprises, and institutions who are compliant with the very basic rule set that respects knowledge sharing, open-sourcing, and community involvement.

Currently, `a-mma` is at its very inception stage. It needs to prove it's capabilities through initially incubated projects before moving into a wider audience.

#### Terminology
1. Agent - An agent can be a human, algorithm, hardware, or other life forms that exchange information and takes action in a common environment.

## List of Incubated Projects
### Open Source Softwares
1. [Aquila Network](https://github.com/Aquila-Network) - One of the base problems to be solved in the Decentralized AI space is the distributed storage and discovery of data. We already have a lot of creative minds hacking in this space. IPFS is one such solution. However, the agents in this decentralized system require another thin layer on top of this data layer - which is the discovery layer, to find information efficiently for processing and decision making. Aquila Network is an initiative to make this happen in a sustainable way possible.

### Open Research
1. [Towards Autonomous Organizations](https://github.com/a-mma/towards_autonomous_organizations) - A unified protocol for Communication and consensus between agents is inevitable. This open research (in progress) explores some aspects of it in an agent-centric way.
